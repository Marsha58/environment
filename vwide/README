How to compile
---------------
Take last sources from repository and perform following steps depending on compilation's type
1. Eclipse
	> Check directory gwt-unitCache and if it contains files - remove them.
	> Remove all files from 'target' directory.
	> Run eclipse. Make sure that eclipse is run under jdk version >= 1.7
	> Perform Clean project
	> Run in debug mode (gwt-dev) mode
2. Maven
	> Check directory gwt-unitCache and if it contains files - remove them.
	> Remove 'target' directory
	> Check src/main/webapp directory on .js files. In case if .js files found there - they must be removed
	> Run mvn clean package
	> Following files 'target/vwide/vwide/vwide.devmode.js' and 'target/vwide/vwide/vwide.nocache.js' must have the same date
	> In case if files mentioned above don't have the same date - perform following steps
	> > mvn gwt:compile
	> > mvn package
	> Upload vwide.war to tomcat
	> run it by catalina.{bat sh} jpda start in case if you wish to debug or catalina.{bat sh} start on regular case

Thats all.
